neatutils
=========

A Simple Reference Utility for Getting the Abbreviation of ML
Estimators,Algorithms and Awesome List

Installation
============

.. code:: bash

    pip install neatutils

Benefits
========

-  Simplify finding ML estimator name for pycaret

Why Neatutils?
==============

-  During usage of the powerful ML library Pycaret, I noticed that it
   was difficult to know which abbreviation/short name can be used each
   ML Estimator, hence we decided to build something simple to make it
   easier to know the most common name/abbreviation for most Machine
   Learning/Data Science Algorithms and Estimators used.

Usage
=====

Get Abbreviations
-----------------

-  Neatutils offers the ability to analyse sequences for more insight

.. code:: python

    >>> import neatutils
    >>> neatutils.get_abbrev('Logistic Regression')
    >>> lr

Get Full Name of Estimators
---------------------------

.. code:: python

    >>> import neatutils
    >>> neatutils.get_fullname('lr')
    'Logistic Regression'
